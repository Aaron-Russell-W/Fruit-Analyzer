# Fruit-Analyzer
2nd Year Data Structures and Algorithms project.
Using image recognition, the program takes a photo from a user and can identify fruit of most colors.
This is done simply by changing the image to black and white. White being instances of fruit and black being just background.
The fruit are then outlined on the next tab in red boxes and you have the option of changing the colors of the fruit to differnt colors across the spectrum.

### Where the project could be improved?
```
The GUI needs massive work it is very bare bones at the moment.
On screen reading of number of fruit.
Organising data in hash sets by number of pixels in each fruit.
```
